# in the future I would like to be able to just import label_image and not run the whole thing inside here
# need to figure out how to scope variable globably and have label_image run after image has been copied and saved
# more analysis is needed
# Things to add: a selection and confirmation of what plant you want analyzed
# A more robust data set for many different plants and diseases
# That way once you check what plant you want run the program can select to test against only those images
# and category of that plant and its diseases
# maybe later have a question tree with like; 'does it have spots or just browned leaves?' etc
# to narrow down results
