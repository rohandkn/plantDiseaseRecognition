# Crop-Disease-Diagnosis
Image Recognition for plant disease detection using Tensorflow for Poets along with a Stack Exchange clone to provide farmers across the globe with the resources and expertise to diagnose and treat plant disease, ultimately increasing crop yield and providing better quality of life for all.

Good place to learn how to use TensorFlow for Poets: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0

Not all files are in this repo for tensorflow to work. You will still need to download and git pull from their repo but the bottlenecks for this project are already made so just use those to retrain so that your tensorflow doesn't have to make new ones(it takes the longest time). 

The zipped file in the web-app folder is just a basic frontend lacking a back-end besides the file uploader. We are still actively working to put everything together.
